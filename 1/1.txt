(1) If each child in the circle is given a number to identify them (alike to an index in an array), when the children begin the game and
    are eventually removed, the 'out' child passes on the potato, leaves, and every child with a number larger than the 'out' child is 
    decremented by 1. An array is limited here by the complications given by random removal of indexes during the game, as other indexes 
    are very likely to be affected by this alteration.

(2) Nine DS in the Sally train story

(3) show the final state of said algorithms
(a) S1 = Empty, S2 = 13,11,9,7,5,3
(b) S1 = Empty, S2 = 11,7,3

(4) S1 = 3,2,12,5, S2 = 12,8

(5) determine whether a stack or queue would be more applicable.
(a) stack
(b) stack
(c) queue
(d) queue
(e) neither
(f) queue
(g) neither
(h) neither
(i) queue
(j) neither

(6) Transfer contents of S1 to S2 using S3 in the SAME order
while (!S1) {
    pop(S1, X);
    push(S3, X);
} 
end while loop;

while (!S3) {
    pop(S3, X);
    push(S2, X);
}
end while loop;
